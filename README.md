# Basic Computer Assembler
This project implements an Assembler for the Basic Computer architecture.
The assembler takes assembly language code as input and generates the corresponding machine code, along with the memory locations, as output.

The assembler is designed following the two-pass assembler approach as explained in Lecture 7
